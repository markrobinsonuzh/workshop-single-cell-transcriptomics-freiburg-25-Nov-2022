# To cover

- read dataset from MTX/CSV format
- do very basic filtering
- call `perCellQCMetrics`, explore various plots
- normalization
- pick highly variable genes
- dimension reduction
- clustering
- viz
- find marker genes

- exercise: use your own dataset, use LC026, or pick a dataset from `scRNAseq` 
  (suggestion: use a dataset with 1 sample or subset to a single sample [batch correction covered in next section])
