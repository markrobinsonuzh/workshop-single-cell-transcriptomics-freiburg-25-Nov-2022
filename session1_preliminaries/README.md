# To cover

- introduction, ice breaker, [yopad](https://yopad.eu/p/freiburg-scrnaseq-workshop)
- setup: bioconductor packages (`BiocManager::install(..)`)
- `quarto`, RStudio projects
- connection to git?
- handling Bioconductor objects: `SingleCellExperiment` (slides)
- options (focus here on BioC, but many choices!)
- renku as backup

- exercise: make a website with `quarto` 
  (1st file: read in 10x data (data provided) OR find dataset in the `scRNAseq` package, save `SingleCellExperiment` in RDS; 
   2nd file: read RDS, make histograms of the cell counts and gene counts)
